#Chat Room Web Application

This is a web application that simulates a basic chat room using React.js. It allows users to register, log in, create messages, view all messages in the chat room, and delete their own messages. The application utilizes Redux for state management and simulates real-time updates using dummy data and timers.

$ npm install

Features
User Registration and Login
Users can register and log in to the chat room application. This functionality is simulated and does not connect to an actual backend service.

Messaging
Logged-in users can create new messages, view all messages in the chat room, and delete their own messages. Each message includes the username of the sender, the text content, and a timestamp indicating when the message was sent.

Redux State Management

Redux is used for state management in the application. The application state includes the user's login status and the messages in the chat room.

Real-time Updates

Although the application does not implement a real-time system with a backend, it simulates real-time updates in the chat room using dummy data and timers. New messages will appear in the chat room and can be viewed by all logged-in users.

User Interface

The user interface of the chat application has been designed to be intuitive and visually appealing. The design follows the principles of responsive design, ensuring a great user experience on both mobile and desktop devices.
